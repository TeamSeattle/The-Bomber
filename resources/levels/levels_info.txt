Welcome to the levels folder

============================
Here we will store all the level files

============================
The files will be in the .txt format
We will name them in the following format

        level_<name>_<number of the level>.txt

        Example:
        level_seattle_1.txt
        level_florida_2.txt
        level_balkan_3.txt

============================
IMPORTANT <---
At the begging of every file (the first line)
we will put a special token to recognize
what the file is for and how we will read it

The token for the level files will be
#leveldata
